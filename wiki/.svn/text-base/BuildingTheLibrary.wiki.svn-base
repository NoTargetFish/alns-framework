We are going to go through the steps needed to build the alns-framework library.


= Details =

First you needed to get the source code of the project to be able to build it.

To do so, in a terminal type the following command : <br/>
<b>svn checkout http://alns-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ alns-framework-read-only</b>

Then you need to build the project and its documentation. To do so, type the following commands : <br/>
<b>cd alns-framework-read-only</b> <br/>
<b>./build.sh</b>

That's all ! The library is now built and can be used.
